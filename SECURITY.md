   - Bundle analysis for security

## 🚨 Common Vulnerabilities We Protect Against

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- All user inputs are sanitized
- Vue.js automatic escaping
- Content Security Policy headers

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- CSRF tokens for state changes
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Origin validation

### SQL Injection
- Parameterized queries (backend guidance)
- Input validation and sanitization
- ORM usage recommendations

### Clickjacking
- X-Frame-Options headers
- CSP frame-ancestors directive
- UI redressing protection

## 🛠️ Security Configuration

### Recommended Headers

```nginx

Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'; img-src 'self' data: https:; font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;

# Other Security Headers
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
X-Frame-Options: DENY
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
